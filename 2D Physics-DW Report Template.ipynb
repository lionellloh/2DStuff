    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature sensors need to reach quasi-thermal equilibrium with the environment in order to measure its temperature accurately. The time taken to reach thermal equilibrium however can be a long wait. For instance, the sensor originally at room temperature takes more than 70 seconds before it is able to reflect the temperature of a water bath at 60 deg celsius. This 70 seconds was the time taken for the sensor to reach quasi-thermal equilibrium with the water bath. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to expedite this process, we augment the hardware with predictive programmes. More specfically, we build a predictive model with training data with Machine Learning algorithms. Using this predictive model, we are able to take raw sensor data from the first 10 seconds to give an accurate temperature of the water bath, with an average standard deviation of 1%.  \n",

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concerns about Time and Space\n",
    "The collection of data was done with the temperature sensor attached to a Raspberry Pi in the classroom.\n",
    "The location for data collection is not trivial as each location has unique environment variables that must be kept as consistent as possible at the point of prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the ambient temperature of the classroom is 0.7 degree cooler than the temperature beside the pantry. Even within the classroom, the temperature at night is 0.4 degree warmer than the temperature in the day, as the air conditioners are switched off at night. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the conditions for data collection can be controlled, our group decided to make special arrangements to collect our data in the day, in the classroom, to keep external variables as consistent as possible. While deviation of such variables might be small, if they are not kept constant, we might still have to factor them in as \"features\" to train our model, which complicates the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collection Method \n",
    "We printed the temperature on the Python3 Shell and saved the Shell outputs as a text file for processing thereafter. We opted for this method as we realised that writing the values to a csv file somehow slowed down the temperature reading interval by 0.08 seconds. This could be due to the additional processing overhead when writing data to files that is especially significant considering the limited RAM of the RPi3. \n",
